# Day 1
Bus ride down down from the Three Valleys to Moutiers, picked up some fuel, and a second bus out to Pralognan.
Hopped on the lift and skinned into the Col de la Vanoise refuge.

# Day 2
A warm up skin up onto the glacier and to the Point de la Rechasse.
Zero visability at the top but found the Madonna.

# Day 3
Transition day to the Refuge de la Femma.
Tough skin in the heat up and over, and a patchy descent to the refuge.

# Day 4
Ascent to the Mean Martin col.
No obvious route up onto the top glacier -- blamed the lack of snow.

# Day 5
Transition to the Refuge Plan du Lac.
Some tough skinning, but nice views at the final Pt.
After dodging rocks, a few nice turns to be found on the descent to the hut.
A spooky night alone in the winter room.

# Day 6
The return to the Col de la Vanoise refuge, via a lovely coffee on a bridge.

# Day 7
An ascent up the glacier to the Col du la Grande Casse.
After enjoy the views, a descent to the village and Grenoble.
